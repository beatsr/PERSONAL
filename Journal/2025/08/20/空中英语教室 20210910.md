## Birdsong and Mental Health

### Certain sounds can be good for us

People often [[#^turn-to|turn to]] nature as a healthy way to ==cope with stress==. Phrases such as "==get some fresh air and exercise==" or "==stop and smell the roses==" ==remind us of== nature's calming benefits. People also consider it relaxing to listen to audio recordings of running water, waves or singing birds. Sound can ==have an [[#^extensive|extensive]] effect on== our ==sense of well-being==. [[#^accordingly|Accordingly]], scientists have long ==sought to== understand the effects of certain sounds on people.

In a recent study, scientists [[#^evaluate|evaluated]] the effect that hearing birdsong had on hikers. They monitored ==a number of== ==hiking trails== in a public park with ==audio recording devices==. This helped them create a bird [[#^count|count]] in the area. They then surveyed visitors to those trails about their ==impression of== bird diversity. They also ==asked for== a report on the visitors' ==sense of well-being==.

The next part of the study ==took place== on the same trails. But the scientists used hidden speakers to ==play recordings== of birds singing. That [[#^give-an-impression|gave the impression that]] there were more birds in the area. They then surveyed visitors who had heard the recordings.

The results of the study indicated that there was a direct relationship between hearing birdsong and an increased sense of well-being.

This result ==builds on== prior ==investigations into== the effects of listening to recordings of natural sounds on people. Those studies have shown that recordings of natural sounds can help with ==stress relief== and the ability to focus. However, the reason behind the benefit is not totally clear.

Perhaps listening to birdsong ==is connected to== a ==sense of calm==. ==After all==, we encounter birdsong in the peaceful part of the morning or following a storm. Or it might relate to a ==sense of safety== [[#^project|projected]] by singing birds. They sing when there are no predators nearby. ==Whatever the reason==, listening to birdsong can ==improve our mental health==.

The authors of the hiking study had an interesting observation. It was the [[#^perception|perception of]] being ==in nature==
with ==a diversity of== singing birds that helped. The authors ==were reluctant to== conclude that just birdsong ==increased well-being==. Instead, they suggested that park managers encourage visitors to enjoy nature
quietly ==as== that provided the greatest benefit.

听鸟鸣能解压？
大自然的声音能疗愈我们的心灵

人们通常将接触大自然当成一种处理压力的健康方式。“呼吸新鲜空气、多运动”或是“享受当下”等警语，都在提醒我们大自然安抚人心的功效。人们也认为聆听录制好的水流、海浪、鸟鸣声能够让人感到放松。声音对我们的幸福感可能具有广泛的影响。因此，科学家长久以来便致力于解开特定声音对人类的影响这一谜题。
科学家在近来一项研究中，评估了聆听鸟鸣声对于徒步者所产生的影响。他们用录音设备监控了一座公共公园里的几条步道，该做法让他们得以掌握该区的鸟类数量。然后，他们再针对造访步道的游客调查他们对于鸟类多样性的印象。此外，他们还会一并咨询游客的幸福感。
接下来的研究部分同样也是在相同的健行步道上进行。不过，这次科学家利用隐藏喇叭播放鸟鸣录音，营造出让游客觉得该区域有更多鸟的感受。然后，他们再针对听到那些鸟鸣录音的游客进行调查。
研究调查结果显示，聆听鸟鸣声与幸福感的提升具有直接关系。这个结果是基于先前的一些相关调查，即聆听自然声音对人类会造成何种影响的调查。那些调查研究早已显示，录制好的自然声音有助于纾解压力及提高专注力。不过，我们并不完全清楚该功效背后的原因。
也许，聆听鸟鸣声和平静感有关。毕竟，我们常会在清晨或是暴风雨后的静谧时刻听到鸟鸣。或者，这可能和鸣唱的鸟所反映出来的安全感有关。鸟只有在附近没有掠食者的情况下才会鸣叫。不论原因是什么，聆听乌鸣声确实能够改善我们的心理健康。
徒步研究的作者团队提出一项有趣的观察结果。正是这种感觉自己身处在大自然里，伴随着多种不同鸣禽的感受，让人获得有效助益。研究团队不愿骤下结论宣称只有鸟鸣声会提升幸福感，反而建议公园管理处应该鼓励游客静静享受大自然，因这样就能带来最大益处。

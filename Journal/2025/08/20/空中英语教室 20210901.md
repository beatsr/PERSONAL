## Stargirl

### How important is it to be like everyone else and fit in?

==Leo Borlock== [[#^attend|attends]] ==Mica High School== in a small ==Arizona town== where everyone is [[#^pretty-much|pretty much]] ==the same==. It isn't ==until== Leo starts 11th grade ==that== anything interesting happens. That year ==Stargirl Caraway== ==arrives at== school. Her usual [[#^attire|attire]] is a pioneer dress. She carries a bag with a sunflower on it and her ==pet rat== in it. At lunchtime she plays her [[#^ukulele|ukulele]] and sings. She knows when it's someone's birthday and sings "Happy Birthday" to them.

She [[#^create-a-sensation|creates a sensation]] when she dances and performs ==on the [[#^field|field]]== before football games. She ==has so much enthusiasm that== she is asked to be a cheerleader. She starts to become popular, and students [[#^imitate|imitate]] her.

==Basketball season== begins, and ==Mica High's team== is winning all of its games. Stargirl cheers ==not only== for Mica High's team ==but also== for the ==[[#^opposing|opposing]] team==. When Mica High reaches the [[#^playoff|playoffs]], Stargirl still ==cheers for== the other teams. She even comforts an opposing player who ==gets injured==. Everyone [[#^furious|is furious with]] her for helping the "enemy." When Mica High loses its next game, Stargirl ==gets blamed==.

==Not only is== Stargirl ==no longer== popular, she ==is also== [[#^shun|shunned]] by the ==majority of== students. But Leo is ==in love with== her, and they start dating. He is [[#^genuinely|genuinely]] happy until he realizes that the ==entire== school is shunning him, too. Leo ==persuades== Stargirl ==to== be like everyone else. To [[#^please|please]] him, she ==goes back to== using her ==real name== - Susan - and ==acts and dresses like== a typical teenager. Later she sees that the change hasn't affected anyone's ==attitude toward== her and ==reverts to== her old self. ==Tired of== being shunned, Leo doesn't go to the final dance of the ==school year==. But Stargirl attends. At the dance, she leads everyone in the "==[[#^bunny|bunny]] hop==." It looks ==as if== she is going to be accepted again. But Hillari, a very popular girl, [[#^slap|slaps]] her. She tells Stargirl that she always ruins everything. Stargirl ==responds by== kissing Hillari on the [[#^cheek|cheek]]. Then she disappears. Fifteen years later Leo notices that Mica High is a more friendly place, and he wonders what ==happened to== Stargirl.

《星星女孩》
像别人一样融入群体当中有多重要？

里欧•布劳克就读亚利桑那州小镇上的迈卡中学，那里几乎每个人都一样。直到里欧升上十一年级，有趣的事才开始发生。那一年，星星女孩•卡拉韦初次来到迈卡中学的校园。她通常穿着一件拓荒时代风格的服装，手上拿着向日葵花图案的袋子，里面则装着她的宠物鼠。午餐时，星星女孩则会弹起尤克里里并高声歌唱。她知道什么时候有人过生日，并且会在当天为他们唱《生日快乐歌》。
足球赛开赛前，星星女孩会在赛场上表演舞蹈，调节气氛。她浑身散发着热情，因而成为啦啦队队员。她开始变得大受欢迎，同学们都争相模仿她。
篮球赛季刚开始，迈卡中学的校队一路过关斩将赢得所有比赛。星星女孩不仅迈卡中学的校队加油，也为对方欢呼。然而当迈卡中学陷人加时赛时，星星女孩仍在为对方加油。她甚至还安慰了一名受伤的对方球员。每个人都对她助长“敌军”声势而怒不可遏。终于在迈卡中学输掉下一场比赛时，星星女孩成为了众矢之的。
星星女孩不仅不再受欢迎，还成为多数同学避之唯恐不及的对象。但是，里欧却爱上了她，他们俩开始约会。里欧真的很开心，直到他意识到整个学校的学生也都在躲着自己。里欧试着说服星星女孩像其他人一样。 为了取悦里欧，星星女孩用回自己的真名苏珊，并且穿着举止都像个典型的青少年。后来，星星女孩发现自己的转变并没有影响任何人对她的态度，于是又重新做起自己。由于里欧已经厌倦了被孤立，因此缺席了该学年的最后一场舞会。不过，星星女孩却出席了。在舞会上，她带领众人大跳“兔子舞” ，看起来她似乎又将重新获得众人的认可。但人缘极佳的女孩希拉里却给了她一巴掌。她怒斥星星女孩指控她总是毁了一切。不过星星女孩却以亲吻希拉里的脸颊作回应，随即便消失无踪。十五年过去了，里欧发现迈卡中学变成了一所更加友善的学校，而他也不禁想知道星星女孩这些年来的故事。

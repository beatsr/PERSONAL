## Noah Jupe - The Teenage Acting Sensation

### Get to know the young star that everyone's talking about

From fighting [[#^alien|aliens]] in ==_A Quiet Place_== to helping his best friend in ==_Wonder_==, Noah Jupe has [[#^play|played]] approximately 20 different characters. And he's only 16!

Noah ==was born in== London on Feb. 25, 2005, to actress ==Katy Cavanagh== and filmmaker ==Chris Jupe. Cavanagh==, a well-known British actress, undoubtedly [[#^pass-down-sth|passed down]] some of her ==natural abilities== to her son.

According to Noah, lots of kids ==dream of== becoming movie stars, and he was ==no exception==. The first time he performed on a real [[#^set|set]], he truly ==fell in love with== acting. His career began in 2015 when he was 10 years old. That year, he ==appeared in== a British TV show, a TV movie and the award-winning series _==Downton Abbey==_.

Two years later, he made his [[#^feature|feature]] film debut in _==The Man with the Iron Heart==_. Since then, he's been [[#^occupied-with|occupied with]] many movie roles and has worked with some of Hollywood's most ==[[#^accomplished|accomplished]] actors==. Noah's been directed by ==George Clooney== and has acted with ==Matt Damon==, ==Nicole Kidman==, ==Christian Bale== and more. He's gathered [[#^a-wealth-of|a wealth of]] information about his profession from his various adult [[#^costar|costars]].

Noah's life has been full of tremendous opportunities. In an interview, he was asked how he stays so [[#^levelheaded|levelheaded]]. He responded: "This industry is a very easy place to ==get lost==." But Noah stressed that he has a great support system at home, and his family helps to keep things normal. He ==made the conscious decision== to stay in school and live in London, ==away from== all the "craziness of Hollywood." This gives Noah the privacy he values.

When he's away on long movie [[#^shoot|shoots]], he can't wait to get back home. He says he loves going home to his family and [[#^chill-out|chilling out]]. According to Noah, the key is "to keep those people who you trust and ==care about== as close as possible."

At some point ==in the future==, Noah hopes to make his own films and continue acting. He says, "I want to do what I'm [[#^be-passionate-about|passionate about]] and keep doing it ==for the rest of my life==!" ==Looking ahead==, we can, no doubt, expect to see more great performances that involve the [[#^notable|notable]] talent of Noah Jupe.

PS: Even though he's British, Noah has a very ==convincing American accent==. He trained with the same voice coach that works with Nicole Kidman.

### Translation

诺亚•尤佩
新生代人气明星

从在电影《寂静之地》中与外星人对抗，到在《奇迹男孩》中力挺好友，诺亚•尤佩前后已饰演了约20个不同的角色。而他只有16岁！
诺亚在2005年2月25日出生于英国伦敦，是女演员凯蒂•卡瓦纳和电影制片人克里斯•尤佩的儿子。卡瓦纳这位知名的英国女演员，肯定将自己的一些天赋遗传给了儿子。
根据诺亚的说法，很多孩子都梦想成为电影明星， 而他也不例外。他在第一次真正上台表演时，就爱上了演戏。诺亚的职业生涯始于2015年，当时他只有10岁。 那年，诺亚分别在一个英国电视节目、一部电视电影， 以及屡获荣的电视剧《唐顿庄园》中露面。
两年后，他在电影《刺杀盖世太保》中首次亮相。 从那时起，他便一直忙碌于演绎诸多电影角色，并且和一些好莱坞巨星合作。诺亚曾参与过乔治•克鲁尼执导的电影，亦曾与马特•达蒙、妮可•基德曼、克里斯蒂安，贝尔等多位明星合作演出。他从一起演出的多位明星前辈那里获得大量关于自己演艺生涯的指点。
诺亚的人生充满了极佳的机遇。他在一次访谈中被问及怎样才能保持如此沉稳。他回答道：“这个圈子很容易让人迷失。”不过，诺亚提到了家人对他的大力支持，而且会帮助他过普通人的生活。他理性地决定自己要留在学校读书并且住在伦敦，以便远离所有一切“好莱坞式的疯狂”。这个决定也给了诺亚自己所看重的个人隐私。
当他长时间离家拍摄电影时，总会迫不及待想回到家里。他喜欢回家和家人聚在一起，然后放松一下。根据诺亚的说法，关键要点就是“尽可能和自己所信任、 关心的人在一起。”
将来，诺亚希望能够自己制作电影并继续演出。他说：“我想要做自己热爱的事，而且要一辈子都这样继续做下去！”展望未来，毫无疑问，我们可以期待看到更多诺亚，尤佩才华出众的表现。
PS: 诺亚虽然是英国人，却能讲地道的美式英语。他的发音指导教练也是妮可，基德曼的教练。

## THE LIFE OF NAPOLEON

### HIGH POINTS AND LOW POINTS IN THE LIFE OF THE FIRST EMPEROR OF FRANCE

Today marks two hundred years since the ==death of== the [[#^general|general]] and first Emperor of France, ==Napoleon Bonaparte==. His story is a [[#^tale-of|tale of]] ==determination to== reach his goals ==in spite of== challenges.

Napoleon ==was born on== the island of Corsica on Aug. 15, 1769, the same year Corsica became a [[#^province|province]] of France. He studied in ==French military schools== and, after graduating early, joined the French army ==at the age of== 16. During the 1790s he rapidly [[#^rise-through-the-ranks|rose through the ranks]]. In 1796, he was [[#^name|named]] [[#^commander|commander]] of the Army of Italy. This struggling ==branch of== France's ==armed forces== recovered under the talented commander's leadership.

But Napoleon was not always successful. In 1798 and 1799 he suffered ==a series of== defeats [[#^abroad|abroad]], which led him to return to France. There he ==participated in== a [[#^coup|coup d'état]], which replaced the elected government with a three-member [[#^consulate|consulate]]. The most powerful member was Napoleon.

In 1800 Napoleon's army defeated the Austrians, ==[[#solidify|solidifying]] his power==. During ==the years that followed==, Napoleon expanded the French empire and ==set up== governments ==loyal to== him in several other European countries.

Through ==political [[#^maneuvering|maneuvering]]==, Napoleon got a new French [[#^constitution|constitution]] approved. ==Soon afterward==, he was elected to the consulate ==for life==, and two years later he was named emperor.

But several years later Napoleon ==made a serious error==. In 1812 he invaded Russia, and he lost many soldiers in the ==bitterly cold== winter. Out of his original army of 600,000, only 10,000 remained who were still able to fight. This weakened Napoleon's forces to the point where he ==surrendered to== his enemies in 1814.

Napoleon was then [[#^banish|banished]] to the ==British island of Elba==. ==The following year==, he escaped the island and returned to France, where he [[#^resume|resumed]] control of the government.

But Napoleon's return was [[#^short-lived|short-lived]]. In June of 1815, the British defeated him at the ==Battle of Waterloo==, and he surrendered a few weeks later.

This time the British sent Napoleon to a more distant island, ==St. Helena,== located in the ==southern Atlantic==. There he lived for several more years before dying in 1821, most likely of ==stomach cancer==. Although he only ==lived to the age of== 51, Napoleon's ==effect on== Europe lasted long beyond his death.

拿破仑传奇
法国第一位皇帝起伏的一生

今天是法国的将军，也是第一位皇帝——拿破仑•波拿巴逝世两百周年纪念日。拿破仑的一生就是一个纵然面对千难万阻也要坚决达成目标的故事。
拿破仑在1769年8月15日出生于科西嘉岛，科西嘉岛在那年稍早才正式成为法国的一省。拿破仑就读于法国军事学校，提早毕业之后在16岁那年加入法国军队。拿破仑在18世纪90年代迅速晋升，并于1796年被任命为意大利军团司令。这支原本在法国军队中处境困顿的部队，在他的领导下恢复了战斗力。
然而，拿破仑并非总是打胜仗。1798~1799年间， 他在海外连打了一连串败仗，只好返回法国。他转而在法国参与了一场政变，成功以三人组成的执政府取代了民选政府，而三人中权力最大的就是拿破仑。
1800年，拿破仑的军队击败奥地利，进一步巩固了他的权力。接下来的几年间，拿破仑扩张了法兰西帝国的版图，并在其他几个欧洲国家扶植起对自己效忠的政府。
通过政治手段，拿破仑推出了一部全新的法国宪法。不久后，他被推选为终身执政官，两年后加冕成为皇帝。
不过几年后，拿破仑犯了一个严重错误。他在1812年人侵俄国，结果在酷寒的严冬中损失了许多士兵。他的军队原本有60万人，最后只剩下1万人还能继续作战。 这严重削弱了拿破仑的部队，导致他最终于1814年向敌人投降。
拿破仑后来被放逐到英国厄尔巴岛。隔年，他逃出岛屿返回法国，并重新掌权。
然而，拿破仑的回归并不长久。1815年6月，英军于滑铁卢战役中打败了他，他也在几个星期之后投降。
这次，英国人把拿破仑送到一座更远的岛屿，那就是位于南大西洋的圣赫勒拿岛。他在那里住了几年后， 于1821年逝世，死因很可能是胃癌。虽然去世时只有51 岁，但拿破仑对欧洲的影响却极为深远。

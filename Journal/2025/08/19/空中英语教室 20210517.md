## Invasive Species: Our Unwelcome Guests

### These badly behaved visitors could be here to stay!

If you picnic in a Texas park, chances are you'll encounter ==fire ants== - a ==[[#^notorious|notorious]] pest== that can deliver painful, itchy [[#^sting|stings]]. This ==invasive species==, like many others, is ==not only== annoying ==but also== expensive and destructive. From Texas to Taiwan, non-native animals, plants, bacteria, [[#^fungi|fungi]] and viruses damage economies and ecosystems.

An invasive species is any kind of living thing that isn't [[#^native|native to]] an ecosystem and causes harm. Sometimes non-native species are imported ==by accident==, like in the 1930s when [[#^cargo|cargo]] ==ships from== South America [[#^inadvertently|inadvertently]] took fire ants to North America. Other times non-native species are imported deliberately. Some types of ==Asian fish== that were originally imported to the U.S. from China to clean fish farms escaped and entered rivers. ==Green iguanas== were brought to China, as pets, but irresponsible owners [[#^release|released]] them. The same thing happened in Florida with ==Burmese pythons==.

Non-native species have even been imported ==for [[#^sentimental|sentimental]] reasons==. A man once released ==dozens of== ==European starlings== in New York in an effort to bring all the birds mentioned in Shakespeare's writings to America. Today, millions of starlings cause over $800 million in ==damages to== U.S. agriculture every year.

Invasive species' global ==economic impact is enormous==. The U.S. government estimates that invasive species cost the American economy over $120 billion every year. The economic impact of fire ants [[#^alone|alone]] totals in the billions.

U.S. agencies spend hundreds of millions fighting invasive species such as ==Asian carp==, ==Africanized bees== and ==Burmese pythons==. In southern Taiwan, green iguanas ==are busy== [[#^wreck|wrecking]] [[#^irrigation|irrigation]] systems, harming agricultural production and threatening the native reptile populations.

Invasive species can devastate their ==host habitats== by unbalancing local ecosystems. They often lack natural predators in their new environment and out-compete native species for food and other resources. They also might [[#^prey-on|prey on]] local species. In Florida, pythons have reduced some regions' local mammal populations ==by== 90 percent. Invasive species can also carry diseases for which local species have no immunity. This can ==result in== the ==loss of== an entire native species.

Alarmingly, the ==National Wildlife Federation== in the U.S. reports that, "Invasive species are among the leading ==threats to== native wildlife. Approximately 42 percent of threatened or endangered species are ==at risk== ==due to== invasive species." Unless people ==take serious action==, the economic and environmental costs of invasive species will become [[#^astronomical|astronomical]].

PS: Invasive species are a huge problem with serious consequences; managing them will require enormous effort.

物种攻防战
不守规矩的不速之客很可能就此鸠占鹊巢！

如果你在美国的一座公园野餐，很可能会碰到火蚁——一种臭名远扬、咬起人来又痛又痒的害虫。这个外来入侵物种就和其他诸多人侵物种一样，不只令人恼怒还很耗费资金且深具破坏性。从得州到台湾，非原生动植物、细菌、真菌以及病毒等无不危害经济及生态系统。
入侵物种是指所有不属于某生态体系的原生物种且会造成危害的生物。有时候，非原生物种是意外被引进，就像20世纪30年代来自南美的货船无意间把火蚁带进北美一样。有时候，非原生物种是故意被引进的，如原本为了清理养殖鱼场而自中国引进美国的一些亚洲鱼种，后来逃脱并进入河川。绿散蜥作为宠物被引进中国，但不负责任的饲主却把它们放走。同样的情况也发生在佛罗里达州的缅甸蟒身上。
非原生物种甚至还因为感情用事的因素被引进。有位男士便试图将所有莎士比亚作品中提到的鸟类都引进美国，因此在纽约放生了数十只欧洲椋鸟。而今，数百万只椋鸟每年都造成美国农业逾8亿美元的损失。
入侵物种对全球经济的冲击极为巨大。美国政府估计，入侵物种每年耗费美国经济成本逾1200亿美元。单是火蚁带来的经济影响就高达数十亿美元。美国政府更斥资数亿美元对抗诸如亚洲鲤鱼、杀人蜂、缅甸蟒等入侵物种。在中国台湾南部，绿鬣蜥专门破坏灌溉系统，造成农产品损害并且威胁到当地爬行动物的数量。
入侵物种会造成当地生态系统失去平衡，继而摧毁寄主栖息地。这些物种在新环境里通常缺乏天敌，因此在食物及其他资源方面的竞争力都胜过原生物种。再入侵物种还有可能会捕食当地物种。在佛州，缅甸蟒已导致一些地区的当地哺乳动物数量减少90%。入侵物种还可能携带了当地物种不具免疫力的疾病，这点则可能导致整个原生物种的全面消失。
令人担忧的是，美国国家野生动物联盟报告道：“入侵物种是原生动植物物种的主要威胁之一。约425 种受到威胁或濒危的物种都是因为人侵物种而处于岌岌可危的困境。“ 除非人们采取严正行动，否则入侵物种所造成的经济与环境损失将扩大到难以估计的地步。
PS：外来入侵物种是一个具有严重后果的巨大问题，妥善处理相关物种需要投注极大心力。

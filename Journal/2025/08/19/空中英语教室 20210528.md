## Neuschwanstein

### The closest thing to a real fairy tale castle

High on a ==rocky hill== in southern Germany [[#^stand|stands]] one of the most [[#^majestic|majestic]] castles in the world, Neuschwanstein. Its [[#^fairy-tale|fairy-tale]] design and ==beautiful [[#^setting|setting]]== make it one of the most photographed buildings in the world. It even [[#^inspire|inspired]] Disney's ==Sleeping Beauty Castle==.

==King Ludwig Il of Bavaria== built it as [[#^escape-from|an escape from]] ==public life==. The shy king [[#^prefer-sth-to-sth|preferred]] the world of the [[#^poetic|poetic]] ==Middle Ages== to the real one. ==Soon after== becoming king in 1864, Ludwig began to [[#^lose-yourself-in-sth|lose himself in]] his imagination and [[#^be-obsessed-with-sth|became obsessed with]] building castles. Construction began on Neuschwanstein in 1869. It ==was== originally ==supposed to== take three years to complete. Ludwig wanted the castle to be perfect, however, so the huge building was not finished even at Ludwig's death in 1886. In fact, it's still not completely finished.

==King Ludwig== was a great admirer and supporter of the world-famous composer ==Richard Wagner==. Neuschwanstein was built [[#^in-sb-honor|in his honor]], and many of its rooms ==were inspired by== Wagner's operas. The castle's name itself is a ==reference to== the ==Swan Knight==, one of Wagner's many characters.

The castle's interior ==is [[#^richly|richly]] decorated== although just 14 rooms were finished by Ludwig's death. ==The Singers' Hall==, which [[#^occupy|occupies]] the fourth floor, contains paintings of characters from ==medieval legends== and ==Wagner's operas==.

The [[#^grotto|grotto]] on the third floor is one of the castle's most unusual rooms. This [[#^artificial|artificial]] cave has a waterfall and colored lighting to ==give it a romantic atmosphere==. Ludwig could go there and ==listen to music== coming from ==the Singers' Hall==.

The bedroom portrays a great ==tale of== romance: ==Tristan und Isolde==, also a ==Wagner opera==. Carpenters [[#^supposedly|supposedly]] spent four years ==working on== the woodwork in this room. The king spent just 11 nights in his palace. On June 12, 1886, his ministers had him declared [[#^insane|insane]] because he was spending too much money building castles. He was arrested, and one day later he was found dead, floating in a lake. ==The cause of death== remains a mystery.

Seven weeks after Ludwig's death, Neuschwanstein [[#^be-open-to-the-public|opened to the public]]. Today over a million people each year visit the castle of the fairy-tale king.

### Translation

新天鹅堡
来自童话世界的城堡

德国南部一座岩石山丘上，高高矗立着世界上最为雄伟壮丽的城堡之一——新天鹅堡。童话般的外观设计以及所处的优美环境无不使得这座城堡荣登世界上最常人镜的建筑物之一。新天鹅堡甚至还是迪士尼乐园中睡美人城堡的灵感来源。
巴伐利亚王国的国王路德维希二世兴建新天鹅堡作为自己公务之余的行宫。这位腼腆的国王偏爱诗意的中古世纪更胜于现实世界。1864年刚登基不久，路德维希便开始沉浸在自己的幻想世界中，大肆兴建城堡。新天鹅堡的建造工程始于1869年。原本预计三年即可竣工， 然而由于路德维希希望城堡能尽善尽美，因此即便到了 1886年他逝世时，这座巨大的建筑仍旧未能完工。事实上，新天鹅堡迄今仍尚未落成。
路德维希国王是举世闻名的作曲家理察德•瓦格纳的崇拜者和资助人。新天鹅城堡的兴建便是在向瓦格纳致敬，其中许多房间的设计构想都是受到瓦格纳歌剧的启发。城堡的名字本身更是取自“天鹅骑士”—一瓦格纳众多歌剧角色之一。
城堡的内部装潢极为华丽，尽管路德维希逝世前只完成了14个房间的工程，其中占据四楼整层空间的歌剧厅还悬挂了中世纪传说故事以及瓦格纳歌剧的人物肖像。
三楼的岩洞则是整座城堡中最为独特的空间。这个人造洞窟内有一座瀑布和五彩灯光，用以营造浪漫的氛围。 路德维希可以到此聆听从歌剧厅所传来的音乐。
寝室则描绘刻画了一个伟大的爱情故事，也是出自瓦格纳的歌剧——《特里斯坦与伊索尔德》。据称木匠耗费4年时间修筑房间内部的木质结构。而国王仅仅在行宫待了11个晚上。 1886年6月12日，路德维希因为兴建城堡耗资过巨而被大臣们宣布精神失常。他遭到软禁，并于一天后被发现身亡，遗体漂浮在一个湖泊上， 死因至今成谜。
路德维希死后7周，新天鹅堡正式对外开放。如今，每年有超过100万名游客会前来造访这座童话国王所建造的城堡。

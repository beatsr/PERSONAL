韩国国民妹妹--lU
艰辛成名史成就人美心美的巨星

韩流明星IU的成名路充满艰辛。IU本名李知恩，1993年5月6日出生于韩国首尔，后来取了艺名IU，就在IU小学毕业后，父亲经商失败，一家人不得不分开以便维持生计。有一年半的时间，IU都是跟着奶奶、弟弟、表姐们住在一个只有一间卧室的公寓里。
IU14岁时，在学校的运动会上演唱。那次经历带给她无限欢乐，因此她决定成为职业歌手。她开始到一家又一家的娱乐公司试唱，两年的时间里，落选了20次。
有一次，IU获得指点，得拿笔钱去交换训练及上电视的机会，她照做了，但到头来却发现那只是一场骗局。
不过，IU并未放弃，且后来终于被LOEN娱乐公司录取成为练习生。她勤奋地训练了10个月，终于在2008年9月18日，以歌曲《迷儿》正式出道。
IU的首支单曲反响算不上热烈，但由于她不断地推出歌曲，于是逐渐打开知名度。如今，她已是韩国流行音乐界数一数二的顶尖歌手。而且IU还为自己的专辑及其他音乐人写了超过50首歌曲。她的歌曲风格多元，因为她的声线能够驾驭各种曲风。
IU同时也参演了多部韩剧，包括《梦想起飞》《步步惊心:丽》、《我的大叔》、《德鲁纳酒店》等。
2020年2月，当新冠疫情侵袭韩国之际，IU捐给韩医学会以及“好邻居”慈善机构各1亿韩元，约8.4万美元，接着在同年八月，又捐赠4600套凉感背心给照料新冠肺炎患者的护理人员。翌月，再度捐赠1亿韩元来纪念自己出道12周年。该笔款项分别捐给提供人工耳蜗以及助听器的一个组织以及韩国未婚妈妈家庭协会。
IU不畏贫困出身，一路走来到现在名利双收，还在继续帮助有需要的人。

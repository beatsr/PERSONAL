### The conservation practice that is helping to restore nature's balance

As a ==gray wolf== [[#^let-out|lets out]] a [[#^mournful|mournful]] cry into the sky, nearby wolves ==answer him with== [[#^high-pitched|high-pitched]] [[#^howl|howls]]. In 1995, after more than a 70-year absence, gray wolves started [[#^roam|roaming]] ==Yellowstone National Park== once again. They weren't always welcome. In the 1920s gray wolves were basically [[#^eliminate|eliminated]] in the Yellowstone Park area. Years later, scientists realized the damage that had been done by [[#^get-rid-of|getting rid of]] one of the park's top predators. ==A [[#^dramatic|dramatic]] increase== in the [[#^elk|elk]] population ==resulted in== the ==destruction of== vast amounts of grass and trees. Smaller animals and insects disappeared ==as a result of== an unbalanced ecosystem.

Conservationist John Davis stated, "Rewilding ... is ==giving the land back to wildlife== and wildlife back to the land." It was in this increasingly popular conservation strategy that a solution was found.

When gray wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone Park, a [[#^shift|shift]] in the landscape ==took place==. The elk population declined, allowing trees to return. This, ==in turn==, [[#^stabilize|stabilized]] the [[#^riverbank|riverbanks]] and cleaned the water. Insects and smaller animals that had ==gone missing== returned. The natural balance had been restored.

In the 1990s conservationist Dave Foreman, co-founder of ==Wild Earth== magazine, invented the term "rewilding." It ==is defined as== "a conservation effort ==focused on== restoring sustainable biodiversity and ecosystem health by protecting core [[#^wilderness|wilderness]] areas." In order to achieve that goal, some conservationists are returning ==native species== to the wild and allowing nature to ==take over==. Other people, however, believe that rewilding methods can be as basic as planting trees or simply not ==interfering with== the land. [[#^at-the-heart-of|At the heart of]] what some consider a fundamental idea is the belief that "nature knows best."

==In various places around the world==, rewilding can be seen with [[#^favorable|favorable]] results. ==In regions of== southern Africa, cheetah and lion restoration programs have proven very successful.

Ages ago, [[#^herd-of|herds of]] European [[#^bison|bison]] thundered across Europe. But they were [[#^hunt|hunted]] for food and sport, which ==led to== their extinction ==in the wild==. Thankfully, Europe's largest land mammal survived because of a [[#^captive|captive]] breeding program. Currently these "ecosystem engineers" are being returned to forests and are [[#^transform|transforming]] the land for the better.

According to rewilding supporters, science clearly shows that [[#^reinstate|reinstating]] missing species is [[#^key-to|key to]] a healthy ecosystem.

PS: A conservation effort called "rewilding" is being successfully used in some parts of the world where the ==absence of== certain species has [[#^upset|upset]] the natural balance.

聚焦世界地球日——再野生化
如何帮助自然界恢复生态平衡

一些灰狼仰天发出凄楚的嚎叫声，附近的狠群随即不断地嚎叫回应。缺席七十多年后，灰狼终于在 1995年再度出现在黄石国家公园。灰狼并不总是那么受欢迎。20世纪20年代，灰狼在黄石公园地区几乎遭到灭绝。数年后，科学家才认识到消灭园中头号掠食者所造成的损害，麋鹿数量大幅增加导致了广大草地以及树木的毁坏。而且由于生态系统不平衡，一些小型动物和昆虫也消失了。
生态保护学家约•戴维斯阐述道：“再野生化……就是把土地还给野生动物，把野生动物还给土地。”就在这个日趋普及的环境保护计划中，有个解决问题的方法被发现了。
当灰狼再次被引进黄石公园时，景观悄然发生了变化。麋鹿的数量在减少，树木得以生长。这转变也因此稳固了河堤，洁净了河水。曾经消失的昆虫和小型动物又回来了。自然平衡于是获得修复。
20世纪90年代，生态保护学室来《野生地球》杂志的共同创办人戴维•佛曼创造了“再野生化”这个词，其定义为“通过保护核心荒野区域，聚集于恢复永续生物经样性与生态系统健全的保育努力”。为了达成该目标，一些生态保护学家将原生物种野放，然后让大自然接手。不过，有些人则认为再野生化的方法可以简单地如植树或单纯地不干扰土地生态即可，在有些人视为根本的概念中， 核心的信念就是“大自然知道怎么做最好”。
在世界各地，再野生化都产生了令人赞许的成效。 在南非一些地区，猎豹和狮子的复育计划结果亦被证明相当成功。
数世纪之前，成群的欧洲野牛奔腾跑在欧洲大陆上，但后来因为食物和娱乐之故遭到猎杀，导致它们在野外绝迹。幸好，由于一项人工圈养繁殖计划，这个欧洲最大的陆上动物得以存活下来。目前，这些“生态系统工程师”重被放回森林，正逐步使这片土地变得更美好。
根据野化支持者的说法，科学证据清楚显示，让消失的物种重新回归生长地对于健全生态环境而言绝对是重中之重。
PS：名为“再野生化”的保育计划成功地在全球一些地方实施，因为那些区域里某些物种的缺席已经影响了自然界的平衡。

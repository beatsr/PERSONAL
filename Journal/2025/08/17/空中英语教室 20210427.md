## The Life Cycle of Sea Turtles

### The average sea turtle spends its days in a fight for its existence

A baby ==sea turtle=='s first venture outside the nest is a ==battle for== survival. As [[#^hatchling|hatchlings]] start ==climbing out from== under the sand, hungry [[#^predator|predators]] watch and wait to catch their next meal.

A sea turtle's ==life cycle== begins on a beach, often in the [[#^tropics|tropics]] or [[#^subtropics|subtropics]]. A female climbs onto the sand and uses her [[#^hind|hind]] [[#^flipper|flippers]] to create a hole about ==50 centimeters deep==. After depositing ==an average of== 100 eggs, she covers the hole and returns to the ocean. Anywhere from 45 to 60 days later, the hatchlings break open their eggshells and ==make their way== up out of their sandy nests. Then they [[#^make-a-dash-for-sth|make a mad dash for]] the sea, guided by the reflection of the moon. Those who reach the water swim [[#^frantically|frantically]] out to sea. Researchers aren't certain, but they [[#^speculate|speculate]] that the hatchlings swim until they reach ==a pile of== sargassum, a [[#^refuge|refuge]] where they hide, eat and grow.

When sea turtles reach [[#^adulthood|adulthood]] - somewhere between 10 and 50 years old, ==depending on== the species - they [[#^mate|mate]] in [[#^shallow|shallow]], coastal waters. The females then return to the exact same beach where they were born to [[#^lay-eggs|lay eggs]], and the cycle begins again.

Seven known Species or sea turtles [[#^inhabit|inhabit]] the ocean: the flatback, green, loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley, leatherback and the hawksbill. Most of them can ==be found in== oceans ==around the world==, ==except for== the chilly waters of the ==Arctic== and ==Antarctic==. The flatback is found only in close [[#^proximity-to|proximity to]] Australia.

Depending on their species, these [[#^reptile|reptiles]] can measure ==up to== two meters ==in length== and weigh more than 900 kilograms. No one knows the exact lifespan of a sea turtle. But some scientists think that those who successfully avoid existing threats can ==live up to== 100 years.

==It's believed==, however, that only one out of every 1,000 hatchlings will reach adulthood, meaning that [[#^the-odds|the odds]] are [[#^squarely|squarely]] against a sea turtle's survival. Predators, ==fishing nets==, ==habitat destruction== and [[#^poach|poaching]] all ==pose a threat==. Another major problem is when sea turtles [[#^consume|consume]] plastic bags and balloons. In the water, these [[#^resemble|resemble]] [[#^jellyfish|jellyfish]], the turtles' favorite food; but eating them usually proves deadly.

Six of the seven species ==are ranked as== threatened, endangered or [[#^critically|critically]] endangered. Therefore, many individuals and organizations are ==working hard== worldwide to ensure that sea turtles never [[#^vanish-from|vanish from]] the planet.

海龟的一生
从出生到回家都危机四伏的“龟”途

海龟宝宝的首次离穴，便是一场关乎生存的冒险战役。刚孵化的小海龟从沙面下奋力向上爬出时，饥饿的掠食者早已在一旁虎视眈眈，伺机猎取即将到手的美味。
海龟的一生始于海滩，通常是在热带或亚热带地区。雌海龟爬上沙滩，用后鳍挖出一个大约50厘米深的洞穴。产下平均约100颗卵之后，海龟妈妈将洞口覆盖好便重返大海。差不多45~60天后，小海龟便会破壳而出，然后再从沙滩下的洞穴一路爬出来。接下来，小海龟会在映射于海面上的月光引导下奋力冲向大海。那些爬到海边的小海龟会拼命游向大海。研究人员目前尚未有定论，不过他们推测刚孵化出来的小海龟会一直游， 直到碰到马尾藻之类的海草丛才会停下，因为这是它们得以藏身、觅食、成长的庇护所。
海龟成年后———依品种不同，成年期介于10~50岁之间，它们便会在较浅的沿海水域进行交配。然后，雌海龟会回到自己出生的那座沙滩上产卵，生命的周期于是再次启动。
全球已知有七种海龟栖息于海洋中：平背龟、绿蠵龟、赤螨龟、肯氏龟、榄蠵龟、棱皮龟以及玳瑁，其中绝大多数可以在全世界除了南北极冰冷海域以外的各大海域看见。不过，平背龟只会在澳大利亚的邻近海域现身。
因品种不同，这些爬行动物的身长最长可达2米、 重逾900公斤。没有人知道海龟的确切寿命。但有些科学家认为，那些成功避开既存威胁的海龟，其寿命可以长达100岁。
然而，据悉每千只孵化的海龟宝宝中只有一只能活到成年，也就是说，海龟幸存的可能性微乎其微。掠食者、捕捞网、栖息地被破坏，以及非法盗捕都构成相当程度的威胁。另一个严重的问题就是海龟会误食塑料袋以及气球。在水中，这些东西和海龟最爱吃的水母很相似，但是，误食后的海龟却往往丢了性命。
七种海龟当中就有六种被列为受威胁、濒危或极危物种。因此，世界各地许多个人和团体机构组织齐心协力，以确保海龟永远不会从地球上消失。

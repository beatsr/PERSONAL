## Easter island, Chile

### The remote site ofan ancient society

Best ==known for== its giantstatues, known as moai, Easter lsland is a remote and beautiful place to visit. The island's English name ==comes from== European explorers who discovered it on Easter morning in 1722. But ==by that time==, the island had already been [inhabited](#^inhabited) ==for centuries==. Around A.D. 400, people from [surrounding](#^surrounding) islands settled on Easter lsland. They called both the island and its people Rapa Nui.

Most of the moai were probably carved and [set up](#^set-up) between the 11th and the 17th century. Over 800 of these giant stone heads, usually ==connected to== torsos, can be found around this tiny island. Many of them ==stand on== platforms called ahu.

No one knows why the Rapa Nui built the ahu and moai. Perhaps the moai represented the people's ancestors. They were generally ==carved from== volcanic rock using simple tools. The Rapa Nui then transported them to their final locations and dropped them into holes that they had already dug. Carving and moving these [statues](#^statue) must have required ==great effort and creativity== in an [age](#^age) without modern technology.

For most of its history Rapa Nui had no visitors from the outside world. lt is about 3,500 kilometers away from [continental](#^continental) Chile and one of the remotest inhabited islands on the planet. The Rapa Nui people developed their civilization with no ==external influence==.

Visitors to Rapa Nui should visit Rano Raraku, the [quarry](#^quarry) where the moai were carved. There, you can see moai in every stage of production. You can also see the largest moai, which [stands](#^stand) 21.6 meters tall.

Ahu Tongariki is another spot worth a visit. After an earthquake in 1960, a Japanese company agreed to help restore the area. That included [setting up](#^set-up) some moai that had ==fallen down==. The result is a [row of](#^row-of) 15 moai - the largest number of the statues ==in one row== on the island.

The northern part of the island also has two small but lovely white sand beaches. And there are many opportunities for [scuba diving](#^scuba-diving).

When you visit Easter lsland, you can explore the [remarkable](#^remarkable) [remnants](#^remnant) of a lost civilization ==different from== any other.

复活节岛
与世隔绝的古老神秘岛屿

以巨大摩艾石像而闻名于世的智利复活节岛，是一处偏远而又美丽的旅游景点。该岛屿的英文名称来自一群欧洲探险家，他们在1722年的复活节清晨发现了这个地方。不过，那时已经有人在岛上居住了数百年。大约在公元400年，来自周围岛屿的人们在复活节岛定居，他们称这座岛屿以及岛上的居民为拉帕努伊。
绝大多数的摩艾石像可能都是在11世纪到17世纪之间雕刻并矗立在那的。这种通常与躯干连接在一走的巨大石雕头像在这座小岛上可以找到超过800座，其中很多摩艾石像都摆置于一种称为“阿胡”的石台上。
没有人知道拉帕努伊人为什么要建造阿胡石台以及台上摩艾石像。也许摩艾石像代表了拉帕努伊人的祖先。摩艾石像通常是利用简单的工具在火山岩上雕刻而成。然后，拉帕努伊人再把这些雕像搬运到目的地，放进早挖好的坑洞里。在缺乏现代科技的古老年代，雕刻和搬运这些石像必定付出了极大的力气和智慧。
纵观复活节岛历史，大部分的时间都没有来自外界的访客。该岛距离智利本土约3500公里，几乎是全球有人居住的岛屿中最偏远的。拉帕努伊人就是在没有外来影响的情况下发展出了自己的文明。
来到复活节岛的游客一定要造访一下拉诺拉拉库，也就是雕刻摩艾石像的采石场。在拉诺拉拉库，你可以看到处于各个生产阶段的摩艾石像，还可以看到高达21.6米的最大摩艾石像。
东加里奇石台则是另一个值得一游的景点。1960年的地震之后，一家日本公司同意协助修复该地。修复工作包括将一些已经倾倒的摩艾石像重新矗立起来。最终的成果就是15座摩艾石像站成一排--是岛上成排雕像中为数最多的一群。
除此之外，岛屿北部有两座小而美的白沙滩，而且，还有很多潜水的机会。
造访复活节岛，你可以探索一个与众不同的失落文明所遗留下来的非凡遗迹。

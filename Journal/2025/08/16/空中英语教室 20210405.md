### How digital media intensifes our prejudices

[Dystopian](#^dystopia) themes in stories like ==The Matrix==, ==Inception== and ==Ready Player One== portray the [struggle](#^struggle) between facing the real world and [[#^embrace|embracing]] a comforting [illusion](#^illusion). Some characters don't know that they=='re trapped in== an [artificial](#^artificial) dream, while others [knowingly](#^knowingly) choose fantasy [over](#^over) reality.

In our ==digital age==, this danger doesn't just ==exist in== fiction. ==Whether we realize it or not==, we're all becoming trapped in “filter bubbles”- invisible, mental cages ==built from== our prejudices and ==desire for== comfort.

We create this trap by doing things like ==exposing ourselves to== politically-[biased](#^biased) news and entertainment or [surrounding ourselves with](#^surround-yourself-with) like-minded friends. Digital [algorithms](#^algorithm) [enhance](#^enhance) our problem by learning what we like and filling our social media with opinion-[affirming](#^affirm) content. The result is a personalized daily environment that ==filters out== contrary ==points of view==.

We become ==fooled into== believing that our opinions about complex issues are unquestionable. Meanwhile, the filter bubbles of those who ==disagree with== us [deceive](#^deceive) them ==in the same way==. This [distorted](#^distort) view of reality ==weakens our thinking==, ==[strains](#^strain) our relationships== and ==[polarizes](#^polarize) our societies==. How can two people have a respectful, open-minded discussion when they both believe that only a stupid or dishonest person would disagree with them?

How do you feel about people who disagree with you? Are they stupid? Are they crazy and [irrational](#^irrational)? Are they dishonest or selfish? lf you answer yes to any of these questions about those who disagree with you, you're probably trapped in a filter bubble.

==Media algorithms== are [[#^intensify|intensifying]] our ==tendency to== self-[segregate](#^segregate) by [reinforcing](#^reinforce) the false perception that our opinions are obviously true and moral. The internet is making us less like a global village and more like a sea of ideological islands [drifting further and further apart](#^drift-apart).

To ==get along with== family, friends and ==fellow citizens==, we must pop our filter bubbles. We can do this by [nurturing](#^nurture) meaningful relationships with people who think differently than us. This lets us experience the reality that people who believe “bad" things can be just ==as good and as intelligentas we are==.

We can also receive balanced information by ==consuming news and entertainment== from across the political and ideological [spectrum](#^spectrum).

Determining right from wrong is complicated. Living outside of our filter bubbles is less comfortable and ==takes effort==, but the personal, relational and societal benefits are rich.

PS: Digital media has a powerful effect on our [[#^perception|perception]]. It creates a filter bubble that [[#^shape|shapes]] the information we consume. This affects our ability to understand and respect the perspectives of other people.

“同温层”现象
数字媒体如何强化你我的偏见

《黑客帝国》、《盗梦空间》、《头号玩家》等故事中的反乌托邦主题，刻画和描绘出人在面对真实世界以及拥抱舒适假象两者之间的挣扎。有些角色根本不知道自己被困在人造梦境里，而有些则是在知情的状况下甘愿抛弃现实、选择幻境。
在我们所处的数字时代，这种危险不只存在于小说中。无论我们有没有意识到这一点，其实我们都被困层层的“过滤气泡”里，那是由自身的偏见以及对于舒适慰藉的渴求所建构的一种无形的心理牢宠。
我们制造这种牢笼的方式，就是通过将自己暴露于带有政治偏见色彩的新闻和娱乐中，或是让自己的身边只环绕着意见想法一致的朋友。数字演算法又会通过我们的喜好，在社交媒体中塞满与我们意见相合的内容。最终的结果，就是营造出一个滤除掉相反观点的个人客制化日常环境。
我们因而误以为自己对于复杂议题的想法及意见正确无虞。与此同时，和我们抱持不同意见的人也以相局的方法欺骗着自己。这种扭曲的现实观削弱我们的思考能力，造成人际关系紧张，更导致社会两极化。两个群体如果各自都认定只有思蠢或不正直的人才会与自己抱持不同意见，那怎么可能进行互相尊重且开诚布公的讨论呢?
你对于和自己意见相左的人有什么感觉？他们愚蠢吗？还是头脑不正常且不理性？还是不正直或是自私自利？如果你在上述这些提问中有任何一个答案是肯定的，那你大概就是困在自己的同温层里了。
媒体演算法强化了我们自我隔绝的倾向，演算法会加深我们的错误观感，认定自己的意见合乎事实与道德。互联网正促使我们越来越不像地球村的居民，反而更像是散布在茫茫意识形态大海中的一座座岛屿，漂流得离彼此越来越远。
为了和家人、朋友、同胞间和谐相处，我们必须打破自己的同温层。我们可以通过与想法不同的人培养建立有意义的关系来做到这一点。此举可以让我们真正了解到，那些怀有“错误”信念的人，很有可能和我们一样善良且聪明。
此外，我们也可以通过观看和收听政治与意识形态范围内差异化的新闻和娱乐节目，来达到接收平衡信息的目的。
决定对错是很复杂的事情。生活在同温层之外让人比较不安心，而且还得费心努力维持，但是这样做给个体、人际关系以及社会相关层面所带来的益处却绝对丰硕。

PS: 数字媒体对于我们的观念感知身有强大的影响力。它会制造一种被称作“过渡气池”的“同温层”现象，足以塑造我们所吸收的信息，世会影响我们理解并尊重他人意见观点的能力。
